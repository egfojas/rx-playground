 ## Official Definition from [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift)
 Rx is a generic abstraction of computation expressed through Observable<Element> interface.
 
 This is a Swift version of Rx.
 
 It tries to port as many concepts from the original version as possible, but some concepts were adapted for more pleasant and performant integration with iOS/macOS environment.
 
 Cross platform documentation can be found on ReactiveX.io.
 
 Like the original Rx, its intention is to enable easy composition of asynchronous operations and event/data streams.
 
 KVO observing, async operations and streams are all unified under abstraction of sequence. This is the reason why Rx is so simple, elegant and powerful.

 ## Eh?
 
 In simple terms, Rx is an implementation of Reactive Programming. It is a tool that can be used **to observe values and changes over time** using the combination of Observables/Streams/Signals and Observers/Subscribers
